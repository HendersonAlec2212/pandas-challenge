I love the oodles of information recieved form user analytics in games. It's faciniating to see decisions made by other people and discover trends as the userbase interacts with a game/world.
## consider breaking down the items into base stats per $/in-game currency similar to LoL chart to perhaps see a trend in the concept of min-maxing purhases made by people
## look ingo the psychology behind market and sizes e.g. movie theatre pop corn --> small = $3 @ 8oz | med = $5 @ 12oz | Lrg = $9 @ 20oz|| you get less per oz fpr Large but it looks llike so much more
Save a pretty - final version with no notes as if you were to give this 'report' to someone that knew jack about coding.
